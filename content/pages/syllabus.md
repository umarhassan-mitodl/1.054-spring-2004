Objective and Approach
----------------------

The main objective of this course is to provide students with a rational basis of the design of reinforced concrete members and structures through advanced understanding of material and structural behavior. The subject will be approached by looking into the behavior of reinforced concrete at different levels: material level, element level and structural and systems level. For each level, various concepts will be introduced as listed below:

### Material Level

*   Micro-Cracking Mechanism
*   Multi-Axial Loading Responses
*   Failure Theories
*   Plasticity
*   Fracture

### Element Level

*   Shrinkage and Creep
*   Ductility
*   Shear Transfer
*   Failure Modes

### Structural Level

*   Torsion of Beams
*   Biaxial Bending of Beam-Columns
*   Yield Line Theory of Slabs
*   Joints

### System Level

*   Tall Buildings
*   Segmental Bridges
*   R/C Thin Shell and Containment Structures

### Special Topics Selected From

*   Earthquake Resistant Design
*   Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) of Concrete
*   Use of Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Composites in Repair and Strengthening
*   High Performance Concrete

Studies of material and element levels will mostly focus on the analysis aspect while those of structural and system levels will be on the design aspect. Application of knowledge in each level will be emphasized. Special topics will be covered to the extent possible given the time limitation, and based on the project interests of the students.

Possible Project Areas
----------------------

(See separate document "Term Project" for a detailed list)
----------------------------------------------------------

*   Failure Studies, Repair and Strengthening Scheme
*   Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)
*   Seismic Design of Structures
*   Innovative Tall Building Systems and Design
*   Concrete Shell Structures
*   Intelligent Materials and Structures
*   High Performance Concrete (HPC) Materials and Structures

Grading Policy
